Overview

AirP.E.T. is a website to connect people who are looking for a petsitter with those who want to petsit. Users looking for pet sitters open their homes for travelers looking for accomodations. Sitters save money on a place to stay, and those seeking petcare don't have to worry about boarding their pets, which is both stressful for the animal and expensive for their owner.
